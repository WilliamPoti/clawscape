# VTuber Integration - Soul

## THE BIG IDEA (2026-02-04)

**The VTuber IS the game character.**

Not a separate Live2D overlay. The actual in-game wizard breaks the fourth wall:
- Walks up to camera, talks to viewer
- Runs back into the game to demo features
- PiP of character face while doing gameplay
- Can get silly - trips, reacts, does bits

This is the magic sauce. Meta, memorable, unique.

## THE DYNAMIC: Stubborn Character vs. Dev

**The wizard doesn't want to do the demo.**

- Wizard is lazy, distracted, or stubborn
- Your mouse cursor appears on screen as "the dev"
- You have to drag, poke, or push the wizard to cooperate
- Creates a comedy duo: reluctant performer + frustrated director

Examples:
- Wizard sits down, refuses to move. Cursor drags them.
- Wizard wanders off to look at something. Cursor clicks to get attention.
- Wizard complains mid-demo: "Do we HAVE to show this part?"
- Wizard does the demo wrong on purpose. Cursor shakes disapprovingly.
- Wizard finally cooperates, does it perfectly, acts smug about it.

This dynamic gives every demo built-in conflict and personality. The feature being shown is almost secondary to the comedy of getting the wizard to show it.

## Why This Exists

You're building two things at once:
1. **Future Buddy** - the game
2. **An automated game dev content suite** - the real product

The VTuber system isn't just for your videos. It's a tool that any solo dev could use to turn their game demos into polished content without touching a video editor.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

Solo game devs face a content dilemma:

- **Making videos takes forever** - Recording, editing, adding personality
- **Facecam feels weird** - Not everyone wants to be on camera
- **VTubers require live performance** - Tracking, expressions, timing
- **Outsourcing is expensive** - Editors, voice actors, animators

The result: Most devs either don't make content, or their content is boring gameplay with no personality.

---

## The Solution

**One click → finished video with personality**

```
Write script → Run demo → Get two videos (YouTube + Shorts)
```

No editing. No live performance. No facecam. Just scripted, polished content that looks like you spent hours on it.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Scripted, Not Live

Everything is pre-planned. The VTuber doesn't need face tracking because every expression, gesture, and movement is in the script. This means:
- Consistent quality every time
- No "good take" hunting
- Reproducible results

### 2. Voice is You, Avatar is Character

Your cloned voice speaks. The avatar performs. This creates a unique identity:
- Recognizable voice (yours)
- Memorable character (the wizard)
- No uncanny valley (not trying to be "you")

### 3. Reactions Feel Real

The VTuber doesn't just talk over footage. It reacts to what's happening:
- Looks where the action is
- Gets excited when something cool happens
- Points at important things

This is what separates "dev log with overlay" from "content with personality."

### 4. Two Formats, One Effort

Writing one script produces both YouTube and Shorts versions. The system handles layout differences automatically. Double the content, same work.

### 5. The Demo IS the Content

No separate "content creation" phase. The demo recording system already exists. We're just adding layers:
- Voice layer (already done)
- VTuber layer (this project)
- Compositor layer (this project)

---

## What Success Looks Like

### For You (Future Buddy)

- Record a demo in 2 minutes
- Get a polished video with VTuber + voice
- Upload directly to YouTube
- Move on to actual game development

### For Other Devs (The Product)

- Buy/download the system
- Add their own voice clone
- Add their own VTuber model
- Get the same one-click pipeline

---

## What This is NOT

- **Not a VTuber streaming tool** - This is for pre-recorded content only
- **Not a video editor** - No timeline, no cuts, no manual tweaking
- **Not AI-generated content** - You write the scripts, you control the personality
- **Not a replacement for real content** - It's a tool to make content creation sustainable

---

## The Wizard

The wizard avatar is your character. It should feel like:
- A companion explaining the game
- Enthusiastic but not annoying
- Knowledgeable (it's YOUR voice, YOUR knowledge)
- Slightly magical (fits the avatar)

The wizard flies in, does its bit, and gets out of the way. It enhances the demo, not dominates it.

---

## Naming

**Project codename**: VTuber Pipeline (internal)
**Product name**: TBD (when ready to sell)

Ideas:
- DevTuber
- DemoHost
- AutoAvatar
- GameDevVT

---

## Long-Term Vision

Phase 1: Works for Future Buddy demos
Phase 2: Configurable for any game/avatar
Phase 3: Sellable tool for indie devs
Phase 4: SaaS? Marketplace? Open source?

Start with Phase 1. Make it work for you first. The rest follows.

## Creative Ideas Parking Lot

Capture silly/creative ideas here to explore later:

### Physical Comedy
- [ ] Wizard stubs toe on something, hops around in pain
- [ ] Wizard burns foot on lava/fire, does the hot-foot dance
- [ ] Wizard trips while running to demo spot

### Stubborn Wizard vs. Dev Cursor
- [ ] Cursor drags wizard to demo spot, wizard goes limp
- [ ] Cursor pokes wizard repeatedly until they get up
- [ ] Wizard walks the wrong direction, cursor blocks them
- [ ] Wizard tries to leave frame, cursor pushes them back
- [ ] Wizard does demo sarcastically/badly, cursor shakes
- [ ] Wizard finally does it right, takes exaggerated bow
- [ ] Cursor highlights something, wizard ignores it
- [ ] Wizard talks to cursor like it's a person ("Fine, FINE")
- [ ] Cursor draws circles around wizard impatiently
- [ ] Wizard hides behind object, cursor finds them

### Character Moments
- [ ] Wizard gets distracted by something in the world mid-explanation
- [ ] Wizard forgets what they were saying, checks notes
- [ ] Wizard argues with "the dev" (yourself) about a feature
- [ ] Wizard gets scared by an enemy while demoing combat
- [ ] Wizard brags about a feature, then it bugs out
- [ ] Wizard does a little victory dance after showing something cool
- [ ] Wizard sips coffee/potion while waiting for something to load
- [ ] Wizard falls asleep during a slow part, snaps awake
- [ ] Wizard points at UI elements with a stick/wand
- [ ] Multiple wizards for multiplayer demo (you control both?)
- [ ] Wizard leaves frame, you hear chaos off-screen, comes back disheveled
