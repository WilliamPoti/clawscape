# Future Buddy #0000003 - Camera Controls
# Duration: ~10 seconds

Camera controls - super important for an isometric game.

Q and E to rotate, scroll wheel to zoom. Smooth interpolation so it doesn't feel janky.

Pretty standard stuff, but it makes the game feel way more polished.

Alright, onto the next feature.
