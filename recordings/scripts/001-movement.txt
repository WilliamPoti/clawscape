# Future Buddy #0000001 - Movement System
# Duration: ~12 seconds

Alright, so first thing I built was the movement system.

Eight directions, smooth pathfinding, and you can hold shift to run.

Click anywhere and your character finds the path automatically - that's A-star doing its thing.

Simple, but it's the foundation for everything else.
