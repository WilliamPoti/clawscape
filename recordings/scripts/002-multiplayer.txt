# Future Buddy #0000002 - Multiplayer Sync
# Duration: ~10 seconds

Now this is where it gets fun - real-time multiplayer.

When someone joins, they just pop into your world. You see them moving around, doing their thing.

And when they disconnect? Gone. Clean.

All synced over WebSockets. No lag, no jank.
