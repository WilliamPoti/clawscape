## How This Works

Every video is recorded using our automated demo system. Script-defined sequences, perfectly timed, with on-screen captions explaining each step. No manual editing.

**Numbering:** Sequential forever. #001 is the first demo, #347 is the 347th. Numbers never reset.

**Updates:** When a feature improves, it gets a NEW number. Old demos stay as history. #004 is early camera controls. #089 might be camera controls v2.

**Length:** 5-30 seconds per demo, depending on complexity.

**For employers/curious devs:** These videos are unlisted but public. Watch the entire development process unfold chronologically.
